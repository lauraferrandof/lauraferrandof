### Hi there 🤗

My name is Laura (she/her) and I'm a frontend developer from Spain, **currently working fully remote** 🚀

After studying Psychology 🧠 I found another passion on **web development** 💻 and decided to pursue my career in this field 🤸‍♀️

💪 I have now **more than 3 years of professional experience as a frontend developer** in B2B SaaS companies within an international and agile working environment, in multiple cross-functional teams where **product-engineering collaboration** was paramount. 👀 I have been involved in a variety of tasks: migrating a legacy codebase from Backone to React, developing new features in **React**, maintaining and developing new components in internal component galleries and design systems, performance tasks, PoCs, documentation...

🙋‍♀️ At a more personal level, even though my ID card says I was born in Madrid, I'm [segoviana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segovia) to the bone. I like writing and photography 📷 which you can currently check out in [my Flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lauus64/), but hopefully I will be hosting my creative work on a personal site soon enough 🙂. I would love to live where the mountains meet the sea 🗻🌊 with at least three cats 😻 and a garden to grow my own vegetables 🍓

🌱 Currently learning JavaScript, React, styled-components, TypeScript, React Query, Webpack... Also interested in starting out with Node.js and learning more about design and design systems 🙌
