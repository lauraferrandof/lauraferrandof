### Hi there 🤗

My name is Laura (she/her) and I'm a Madrid-based frontend developer, currently working full remote at [Beezy](https://www.beezy.net/) 🚀

After studying Psychology I found another passion on web development, and decided to pursue my career in this field 🤸‍♀️

Even though my ID card says I was born in Madrid, I'm [segoviana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segovia) to the bone. I used to play violin in a music band called Hasta El Moño (loosely translatable as something like "fed up"), you can see our live performances on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93dUTN66ezQ) (plz don't judge too hard, we were young and inexperienced 🙏).

I also like writing and photography, you can check out [my Flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/lauus64/). Hopefully I will be hosting my creative work on a personal site soon enough 🙂

Currently learning JavaScript, React, Sass, Webpack... Looking forward to starting out with TypeScript to see what all the fuss is about, and Node.js to get the full picture of a feature development 🙌
